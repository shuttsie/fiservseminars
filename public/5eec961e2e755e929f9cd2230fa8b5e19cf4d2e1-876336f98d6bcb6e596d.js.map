This abstraction also enables uploading\n * streams of unknown size due to the use of multipart uploads.\n *\n * To construct a managed upload object, see the {constructor} function.\n *\n * ## Tracking upload progress\n *\n * The managed upload object can also track progress by attaching an\n * 'httpUploadProgress' listener to the upload manager. This event is similar\n * to {AWS.Request~httpUploadProgress} but groups all concurrent upload progress\n * into a single event. See {AWS.S3.ManagedUpload~httpUploadProgress} for more\n * information.\n *\n * ## Handling Multipart Cleanup\n *\n * By default, this class will automatically clean up any multipart uploads\n * when an individual part upload fails. This behavior can be disabled in order\n * to manually handle failures by setting the `leavePartsOnError` configuration\n * option to `true` when initializing the upload object.\n *\n * @!event httpUploadProgress(progress)\n *   Triggered when the uploader has uploaded more data.\n *   @note The `total` property may not be set if the stream being uploaded has\n *     not yet finished chunking.
